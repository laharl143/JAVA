//How I wrote this code? Step by step:
//public class boiler plate   line of code #1
//main() boiler plate           line of code #2 + run | Debug
//System.out.println boiler plate    line of code #3
//then I wrote the Hello Java        line of code #3

// How to compile and run JAVA code:
// Step 1: write "javac .\<JavaFileName>.java" in terminal, this is to compile the java file
// Step 2: write "java <JavaFileName>".class in terminal to run the compiled file.

// FAQS:
// Why use char?
// Memory: char consumes less memory
// Performance: char is faster than string

// Rule of thumb:
// Use char to store single characters
// Use String to store text

// Notes: 
// int variables can only store from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,648  ; only in the 2billion range
//      Amount of memory: 4bytes 

// long variables can only store from -9,223,372,036,854,775,807 to +9,223,372,036,854,775,807 ; up to 9 quintillion range
//      Amount of memory: 8bytes 


// Why not always use long?
// long takes 8bytes of memory compared to int which is only 4bytes ; hence it is faster
